**Snapshot of the Simple Dashboard produced for this project.**


# INTRODUCTION
This project produced a simple dashboard using the dataset collected by a bike sales business. The dataset consisted of customer demographics and customer behavior.

The dashboard used clearly labelled charts to present the results from the analysis of the CLEANED, UNFILTERED dataset, and the results from the analysis of the dataset (FILTERED based on Gender, Marital Status, and Region) as well.

Analysis of Customer Behavior based on age, gender, and income class produced invaluable insights that could be useful to the business. For instance, REGION PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS (in terms of conversion rate of customers) was actualized and presented.

This project is SIMPLISTIC and involves only the use of the Data Validation Tool, Excel expressions, and Charts. Advanced tools like PIVOT TABLE, POWER QUERY, and POWER PIVOT were not involved.

#### P/S: 
This is ONLY A SIMPLE ILLUSTRATION TO PRESENT A DIFFERENT INSIGHT INTO THE POPULAR DATASET.

#### DISCLAIMER: 
The data for this project was gotten from ALEX THE ANALYST.

# BACKGROUND

Organizations rely on data to enable them to understand their business performance and make decisions that will impact future operations. So long as the dataset used is accurate and devoid of errors, it is believed that decisions made (based on the data) are unbiased and give a true picture of events.

A Bike Sales Outlet, ABS Cycles, collected Bike Buyers Data comprising customer personal information, and customer behavior (whether they made a purchase or not) from three regions where the business operated. The business wanted to know if this available data was useful in any way, and if the dataset could subsequently provide insights that could form a basis for any future decision.

The following are the questions to be answered;
1.	Can any information (useful to the business operation) be derived from the data set?

2.	Is the business Gender specific? What is the distribution of gender in the business data?

3.	What is the distribution of customers by Age group? Which age group is MORE LIKELY to make a purchase?
4.	What Income Groups did the business appeal to? Which Income-Group comprised the most clients/customers?
5.	Which Region had the most visits?

6.	Which Region had the highest conversion rate (i.e. highest percentage of visitors that made a purchase)?
